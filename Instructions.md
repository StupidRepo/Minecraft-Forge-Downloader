For downloading forge through python.

# Instructions + How to Launch (MacOS)

Thanks for downloading MFD (Minecraft Forge Downloader)!
Here is how you download forge if your using it on macOS.

* First, download MFD for MacOS then extract it win 7Zip (Please download 7Zip as it is free and way better than WinRAR and you DO NOT EVEN NEED TO PAY A PENNY for it!)

* Second, download Python 3. MacOS automatically comes with Python 2 which cannot run such advanced things

* Third, open up Terminal and type `pip3 install requests` and then `pip3 install json`. If installing the JSON one errors then you don't need to worry about installing it.

* Fourth, close that Terminal window and open a new one. In the NEW window, type in `python3` with a space at the end then drag the .py file into the terminal and press enter. If your doing the installer it should look something like this: `python3 /Users/Your Username/Documents/Forge\ Downloader\ -\ Forge\ MC\ Installer/Download_Forge_Installer_MacOS.py`. If your doing the manual installer, it should look something like this: `python3 /Users/Your Username/Documents/Forge\ Downloader\ -\ MacOS/Forge\ Downloader\ -\ Forge\ MC\ JAR/Download_Forge_MC_Jar_MacOS.py`

* Fifth, once it says it's done, double click on the installer in your downloads folder IF you used the installer downloader. If you didn't use the installer downloader and your doing the manual installer then you'll have to figure it out yourself since I don't know how to manually install forge ***lol***.

# Instructions + How to Launch (Windows)

Now the Windows way of doing it is like macOS except you download and open up the windows zip instead of the macOS zip (yes there labeled with the OS) and run the installer downloader or manual install downloader (using the same command `python3` and dragging the py file in.

Since I'm not on windows, I'm not sure it'll download/work. If it does, have fun else if it doesn't, go to the Issues tab and tell me what it says by reporting an issue :)
